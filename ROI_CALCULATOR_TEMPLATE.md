## ðŸŽ¯ **ROI Calculation Formulas**

### **Strategic Planning Time Savings**
```
Current Cost = (Weeks Ã— Weekly Cost) + Opportunity Cost
Mercer Cost = (Reduced Weeks Ã— Weekly Cost) + Opportunity Cost
Savings = Current Cost - Mercer Cost
```

### **Consulting Cost Reduction**
```
Current Consulting = Annual Consulting Spend
Mercer Cost = Annual License + Reduced Consulting
Savings = Current Consulting - Mercer Cost
```

### **Compensation Error Reduction**
```
Current Errors = (Error Rate Ã— Total Compensation Budget)
Mercer Errors = (Reduced Error Rate Ã— Total Compensation Budget)
Savings = Current Errors - Mercer Errors
```

### **Retention Improvement**
```
Current Turnover Cost = (Turnover Rate Ã— Average Cost per Turnover)
Mercer Turnover Cost = (Improved Rate Ã— Average Cost per Turnover)
Savings = Current Turnover Cost - Mercer Turnover Cost
```

### **Productivity Gains**
```
Current Productivity = (Current Rate Ã— Total Workforce Cost)
Mercer Productivity = (Improved Rate Ã— Total Workforce Cost)
Value = Mercer Productivity - Current Productivity
```
